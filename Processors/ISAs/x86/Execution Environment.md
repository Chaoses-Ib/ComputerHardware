# Execution Environment
## IA-32 / Intel 64
Any program or task running on an IA-32 / Intel 64 processor is given a set of resources for executing instructions and for storing code, data, and state information. These resources make up the basic execution environment for an IA-32 / Intel 64 processor:
- Address space
- Stack  
	To support procedure or subroutine calls and the passing of parameters between procedures or subroutines, a stack and stack management resources are included in the execution environment.
- Basic program execution registers
	- Eight/Sixteen general-purpose registers
	- Six segment registers (16-bit)
	- FLAGS register
	- Instruction pointer register
	
	These registers comprise a basic execution environment in which to execute a set of general-purpose instructions.
- x87 FPU registers
	- Eight x87 FPU data registers (80-bit)
	- Control register (16-bit)
	- Status register (16-bit)
	- Tag register (16-bit)
	- Opcode register (11-bit)
	- FPU instruction pointer register (48-bit)
	- FPU operand (data) pointer register (48-bit)
	
	These registers provide an execution environment for operating on single-precision, double-precision, and double extended-precision floating-point values, word integers, doubleword integers, quadword integers, and binary coded decimal values.
- Eight MMX registers (64-bit)
- Eight/Sixteen XMM registers (128-bit) and MXCSR register (32-bit)
- Eight/Sixteen YMM registers (256-bit)
- Bounds registers
	- BND0-BND3  
		Each of the BND0-BND3 register stores the lower and upper bounds (64 bits each) associated with the pointer to a memory buffer. They support execution of the Intel MPX instructions.
	- BNDCFGU and BNDSTATUS  
		BNDCFGU configures user mode MPX operations on bounds checking. BNDSTATUS provides additional information on the \#BR caused by an MPX operation.

In addition to the resources provided in the basic execution environment, the IA-32 architecture provides the following resources as part of its system-level architecture. They provide extensive support for operating-system and system-development software:[^sdm]
- I/O ports
- Control registers  
	The five control registers (CR0-CR4) determine the operating mode of the processor and the characteristics of the currently executing task. Intel 64 adds the task priority register (CR8).
- Memory management registers
	- Global descriptor table register (GDTR)
	- Interrupt descriptor table register (IDTR)
	- Task register (TR)
	- Local descriptor table register (LDTR)

	These registers specify the locations of data structures used in protected mode memory management.
- Debug registers  
	The debug registers (DR0-DR7) control and allow monitoring of the processor’s debugging operations.
- Memory type range registers  
	The MTRRs are used to assign memory types to regions of memory.
- Model-specific registers  
	The processor provides a variety of model-specific registers that are used to control and report on processor performance.
- Machine check registers  
	The machine check registers consist of a set of control, status, and error-reporting MSRs that are used to detect and report on hardware (machine) errors.
- Performance monitoring counters  
	The performance monitoring counters allow processor performance events to be monitored.
