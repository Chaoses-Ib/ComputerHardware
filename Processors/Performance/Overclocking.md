  > 简单来说锐龙7000如果默认跑，核心数负载越小单核的频率越高，核心数负载越大频率就会越低，手动超频就是让CPU以一个固定的频率运行，二者都有各自的缺陷。自适应双模超频主要作用就是设置一个拐点，在拐点以前都采用锐龙7000的默认跑，可以跑出比手动超频更高的频率。过了拐点以后，就切换到手动超频模式跑，让多核恒定频率。可以说这个模式是结合了CPU的默认频率调度方案和手动超频两种方式各自的有点，最大化发挥锐龙7000处理器单核和多核的性能，更好地兼顾游戏和生产力的实际使用需求，是一个比较实用的功能

  温度墙不明，即使 level 1 也可能达到 110℃。功耗也很大。

History:

### Zen 4
[95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips. : r/Amd](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xqsa2j/95c_ryzen_7000_is_not_the_whole_story_here_is/)
> The way Ryzen 7000 operates seems to essentially be: run up to the temp limit and adjust clocks as needed without a hard throttle. More cooling is simply offset by higher clocks/performance at the same 95C (or 90C on lower models).

> 95C core temp is not (and never was) dangerous, the problem is that if your CPU was working at 95C a bad timed boost in power draw could send you over the actual limits, so the CPU boosting system needed to anticipate. This behavior just right before hitting thermal limits is what we call thermal throttling.
> 
> AMD has decided to change this design procedure, likely because with the newer manufacturing nodes base clocks could in theory be way higher, but thermal requirements would rise significantly. Instead of trying to create clock/thermal set points a priori, AMD has decided to create a series of CPUs that use temperature as the first control variable (not the third), that way they ensure the cooler is working at max efficiency and simplify the logic.
> 
> This means that you don’t really see thermal throttling with this gen, you see the CPUs scaling with temperature. In other words, there’s no “thermal wall” that suddenly tanks your performance. If you look at OPs data, you’ll see there’s no sudden gap in Cinebench scores, they just rise linearly with cooling capacity.

> Makes me think that the 95C target avoids a ton of heat-cycles, preventing premature degradation of the silicon? Might be a new issue they had to deal with considering how small transistors have become. Better to sit at 95C than to fluctuate hundreds of times per minute.

- Doesn't that also mean your cooler is going to be running at full blast a lot more?

  > with this 95C behavior you basically lose all fan control as how are you gonna do a fan curve when the chip just decides it wants to be 90C+ at high loads.

  > I think its even easier now compared to before? As the chip targets 95 degrees out of the box, adjusting fan speed only affect core clock, not performance. If you want the best, crank the speed up, if not just leave it at you preferred noise level. And it only affect heavy professional workload, for gaming the temp is gonna be at least 20 degrees lower at stock.

> EXPO and fan curves set and everything else default. I did mess around with PBO for a while but all I was seeing was lower clock speeds, similar performance and general system instability. So, I went back to stock.

## [Disadvantages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking#Disadvantages)
> Nah, worst you could do is get a temporarily unstable cpu or in this case a one that consumes more power (that is unless you mess with the voltage too much). The default settings are with a considerable margin so that all samples achieve advertised clocks/TDP but in reality most of them can do slightly better.
