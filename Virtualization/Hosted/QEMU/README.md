[RetroTech Chris on X: "It's probably been ten years since I last used the QEMU emulator. I thought to myself, "How hard could it be to get QEMU running with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with good sound, networking, and video in 2025"? Oh, man... okay, let's talk about it in a üßµ here."](https://x.com/RetroTechChris/status/1891660787388747779)

> Since the previous update, some mistakes in the early bindings code have become apparent; in particular, orphan rules made it too hard to implement classes outside the qemu_api crate, and in general to split the qemu_api crate in multiple parts---for example, parts that are of interest to tools and parts that are only used by system emulators. Another important change is the separation between bindgen-generated types and the structs that are actually used by Rust code. This allows traits such as Send, Sync or Zeroable to be specified independently for C and Rust structs."

> It's definitely good that they defaulted to a more restrictive model so they don't need to bolt on checks after the mess has been made, but a CORS type permission system would be very nice.

> The idea has been brought up over the years. There is some work to be done to design a solution that retains the composability guarantees people want but my impression is that the big hold-up is the sense of priorities.
